# Global Severe Weather Event Tracking
- Used NASA's Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) API to collect global weather data and display on Google Maps
- Currently, my application only supports wildfire tracking

# Planned Additions
- Volcanoes, icebergs and other single location event mapping
- Mapping of events that span multiple sets of coordinates e.g. tropical storms and others
- better styling
- an event search function
